                <hr>
                <p>Sree Peralassery temple is located in Peralassery, Kannur, and is a well-known pilgrimage site in Kerala's North Malabar region. Lord Subramanya is the major deity worshipped here. The temple can be traced back to the Thretha Yuga. According to the Ramayana, Lord Sree Rama, Lakshmana, and Hanuman stopped here on their route to Lanka in quest of Sita (Sree Rama's spouse), and felt the presence of Lord Subramanya. Sree Rama decided to sanctify Lord Subramanya's idol in this location after receiving permission from Lord Ayyappa. He dispatched Hanuman to the north in search of a suitable idol. Sree Rama removed his Peruvala [great bangle] after he failed to arrive for consecration on time.As a result, the town was given the name Peruvalassery, which was later shortened to Peralassery. Later, Hanuman attempted to remove the bracelet in order to consecrate the idol, but he was unable to do so due to a serpent's warning.


                    Hen's eggs are the principal offerings in the temple, which is known for snake worship. The annual Kodiyettam festival, which takes place in December, is a major draw. During festival seasons, traditional temple art forms like as Thayambaka, Irattathayambaka, Chakyarkoothu, Pattakam Ottan Thullal, and Kathakali are performed in the temple. You will feel elated and spiritually stimulated after visiting the temple during this period.

                <hr>
                <p>Mamaanikkunnu devi temple is a well-known spiritual centre in Kerala, famous for its "Sakthi Pooja" tradition. The edifice is situated on a raised platform on the eastern side of the Irikkkur River, as its name suggests. In actuality, it's a really old temple with very little infrastructure. I believe it is past due for a complete restoration.

                    Devotees flock here to beg the mother of the universe to accept solutions to their life's unending problems, such as delayed marriage, infertility, and so on. Tantric-based rituals are practised here.
                    
                    Despite the fact that Shiva is the presiding deity, the temple is recognised by the goddess's name. The fact that "Sapta mataakkal" means "seven cosmic mothers" piqued my interest. <b>Location:Irikkur, Kerala 670593</b> </p>
