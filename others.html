                    <hr>
                    <p>This surviving historical monument known as St Angelo Fort, sometimes known as Kannur Fort, offers visitors a trip
                    through the centuries. The imperial walls of this fort, which were built by the Portuguese Viceroy, Don Francesco de
                    Almeida, in 1505 CE, practically carry the annals of trade, colonialism, and wars. The Dutch took this fort in 1663 CE,
                    made some changes, and eventually sold it to Ali Raja of the Arakkal dynasty. In 1790 CE, the British seized the fort
                    and utilised it as a military station. The Archaeology Survey of India currently protects the fort.The fort was erected in a triangular shape utilising laterite stones and a surkhi [brick dust] mixture. Three
                    magnificent and massive bastions, a lighthouse, cannons, barracks, and tombstones are among the fort's significant
                    features. Walking along the fort's walls, you can't help but be impressed by the breathtaking views of the natural
                    harbour, Mapilla Bay, and the lesser-known but fascinating Dharmadam island near Thalassery. <br> <b>Visiting Hours: 08.00 am to 06.00 pm <br>Coordinates:11.8541° N, 75.3714° E</b></p>

                   <p>The lighthouse in Kannur is the first lighthouse built in Kerala, standing at a height of 75 feet. The building, which
                dates back to 1903, has both historical and cultural significance. The vantage point provides stunning and awe-inspiring
                views of Kannur's entire district, the Arabian Sea's immense extent, and the Baby Beach.
                
                The viewer will be enchanted by the beautiful scenery, and the feeling of the wind on your face at the highest point
                will leave you gasping for air. In the evenings, tourists can take a leisurely stroll around the well-kept gardens and
                watch the fascinating water fountain show. <br> <b>Distance: 2.6 km from Kannur bus stand

                <h1>Mappila Bay</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Mappila Bay (also known as Moppila Bay) is a natural harbour near Ayikkara, Kannur Municipal Corporation, Kerala,
                India.Fort St. Angelo, built by the Portuguese in the 15th century on one side of the harbour, and the Arakkal Palace on
                the other.
                
                During the Kolathiri's rule, the bay was well-known as a commercial port that transported goods between Kolathunadu and
                Lakshadweep and other countries.Without a doubt, Mappila Bay is a beautiful tourist destination. Unfortunately, it is currently more of a fishing port
                than a tourist attraction.
                
                This natural harbour, which is separated from the Kannur or St. Angelo's Fort, comes after the beaches. Another
                interesting site to see is the Arakkal Palace. Both of these sites are remnants of Portuguese conquests, however they
                are now uninhabited. The Ali Raja Royal dynasty, Kerala's only local royal family until today, owned the Arakkal Palace.
                The royal family still owns the palace, which has been converted into a museum that is open to the public for a small
                price. Apart from that, this location is ideal for picnics and as a lookout point. <br> <b>How to reach:The bay is located at Ayikkara, 3 kilometres from Kannur town. Reaching here from town is easy. The best option is to
                hire one of the Auto-Rickshaws whizzing around.</b></p>

                <hr>
                <p>Madayipara is a stunning laterite plateau that tells a different storey with each season's brilliant hues. Colors abound
                in this breathtaking scene. While rain blankets the area in a lush green blanket, Summer delivers the sun's colours, and
                Spring transforms it into a sea of blue.
                
                This hillock in Kannur district, which covers 700 acres, is a mix of natural beauty and historical significance. It also
                boasts an ancient fort, the Madayi Fort, built by the Vallabha King of the Kolothu dynasty, and a Jew pond, which
                contains the remnants of the ancient Jew settlers.
                
                
                
                Madayipara is an ecological haven, home to a diverse range of vegetation and fauna. It features a unique assortment of plants that consume insects. It also has a pond in the shape of a portable mirror, as
                well as hundreds of bird and butterfly species.
                
                
                The location also has religious importance. The Madayi Kavu, which holds the Pooram festival, as well as the Vadukunda
                Shiva Temple, make this a popular pilgrimage site. <br> <b>Location:Pazhayangadi, Kerala  <br> Coordinates:12.0323° N, 75.2567° E</b></p>

                <hr>
                <p>Dharmadom Island, located about 100 metres from Dharmadom Beach's immaculate shoreline, has become a popular destination
                for travellers looking for a peaceful and tranquil picnic place. This isolated island is surrounded on three sides by
                mainland rivers and the sea on the other by a canopy of coconut palms and dense shrubs. It is only accessible at low
                tide, and strolls around the area provide a spectacular view of the Anjarakandy and Thalassery Rivers confluence.Dharmadam Island (Green Island) is a 2-hectare private island in Kerala's Thalassery district. Dharmadam is roughly 100
                metres from the mainland. The island, which is surrounded by lush shrubbery and coconut palms, can be seen from
                Muzhappilangad beach, where permitted visitors can walk out to the island during low tide. Dharmadam was previously
                known as Dharmapattanam.
                
                This area was taken over by the Kerala government for tourism development in 1998.
                
                Dharmadam is about 4 kilometres from Thalassery. <br> <b>Coordinates:11° 46′ 11.28″ N, 75° 27′ 1.8″ E</b></p>

                power. It stands proudly in Thalassery, a little town 22 kilometres from Kannur's northern district. The fort was built
                in 1703 by the East India Company, which had previously established its settlement on the Malabar Coast in 1683, and was
                once the heart of Thalassery's development. Enormous walls, massive, artistically carved doors, and secret tunnels
                leading to the sea make the stunning square fort a joy to explore. <br> <b>Address: Near Thalassery New Bus Stand Kanyakumari, Panvel Highway, Pilakool, Thalassery, Kerala 670103 <br>Coordinates:11.748292°N 75.486134°E</b></p>

                Arakkalkettu Museum is a portion of the Arakkalkettu (Arakkal Royal Palace). The Kerala government has turned the durbar
                hall area of the palace into a museum. After a Rs. 9,000,000 restoration, it reopened in July 2005.
                
                The Arakkalkettu is still owned by the Arakkal Royal Trust and is not under the supervision of the country's
                archaeological department, the Archaeological Survey of India, despite the government's renovations. The government had
                taken a particular interest in maintaining the Arakkal family's heritage, which had played a significant role in the

                a violent demon after a local king betrayed and murdered her, according to legend. But she took on a motherly aspect
                after a man mistook her for a loving mother.  On his way back from Kottiyoor, the Goddess was accompanied by a priest of
                Kalikattu illam. Goddess then requested to be erected in this jungle site where leopards and livestock coexisted
                peacefully.The jungle environs are still preserved at eeliyar Kottam. It has no roof over its sanctum. The Goddess favours the
                Neeliyar Kottam grooves anytime a devotee makes a sacrifice, even though the ceremonial Theyyam performance is performed
                elsewhere. The Theyyam costume consists of a 20-foot bamboo-framed headdress and traditional Theyyam accessories, as
